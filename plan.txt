Project goal: create age prediction model based on humour styles data.

3 algorithms:
pick two different types of regression as well as a classifier on binned age groups

probably Ridge regression, LASSO, and kNN

exploratory data analysis
make some charts showing the distributions of each feature

Data Preparation
same for all 3 algs except kNN neads age group binning (likely into quantile groups either 20% or 25% probably)
train-test split and then use cross validation
cleaning - eg remove clearly wrong ages (anything over 123 - oldest person ever was 122), remove missing values (-1 for q1 - 32 and 0 for gender although may combine the 0s with 3s ie the other category - others have no missing values)
wont include the final 4 hsq scores as these are dependent on the 32 questions (avoid multicollinearity - maybe include a source about this?)
Feature scaling - standardisation as it facilitates convergence for gradient descent (although may try raw and normalised as well and see which is best) may use normalised for kNN
one-hot encoding for gender as its not ordinal

1: Ridge regression
